# Kaimi - The Seeker

**Kaimi** (Hawaiian for "the seeker") is an autonomous business-development pipeline for federal government contracting. It hunts live federal opportunities on SAM.gov, scores them bid/no-bid against a company's capabilities, and drafts tailored proposals - with human review before submission.

This is production infrastructure for BlueMeta Technologies' BD operations, built to run for years, not as a demo.

## Architecture

Kaimi operates in two distinct zones:

### Zone 1 - Scheduled Pipeline (Daily Batch)
```
Hunter → Scorer → Opportunity Queue (Dashboard)
```
- **Hunter**: Pulls and filters opportunities from SAM.gov by NAICS code
- **Scorer**: Scores each opportunity for bid/no-bid fit with reasoning
- **Queue**: Shared store of scored opportunities awaiting selection

### Zone 2 - Per-Proposal Lifecycle (Orchestrated)
```
Manager → Outline → Technical Writer → [HUMAN GATE] → Final Review
```
Triggered when an opportunity is selected. A Manager agent coordinates specialist agents to draft a complete proposal, pausing for human review before finalization.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for full system design and [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md) for development workflow.

## Current Status

**Phase 0**: Foundation and project structure
- Go module initialized
- Project structure created
- Core interfaces defined (Store, SAM.gov Client)
- Opportunity schema designed for all phases

**Next**: Hunter agent implementation (Phase 0 continuation)

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go (for concurrency, Google-native fit, single-binary deployment)
- **Agent Framework**: Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) v1.0+
- **LLM**: Gemini 3 Pro via Vertex AI
- **Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform / Vertex AI

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- golangci-lint (for linting)

### Build
```bash
# Build all packages
make build

# Or build specific binary
go build -o bin/hunter ./cmd/hunter
```

## Run Instructions

### Hunter Agent
```bash
# Run the Hunter agent (placeholder in Phase 0)
./bin/hunter
```

**Note**: Full Hunter implementation is in progress. Current binary is a placeholder.

## Test Instructions

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test -v ./internal/opportunity

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

## Development Workflow

All development follows the workflow defined in [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md):
1. Work is tracked via GitHub Issues with approved acceptance criteria
2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) required
3. All PRs must pass tests and linter
4. AI sub-agent code review before human review
5. Human approval required for all merges

### Common Make Targets
```bash
make all        # Build, test, and lint (run before PR)
make build      # Build all binaries
make test       # Run all tests
make lint       # Run linter
make clean      # Remove build artifacts
make help       # Show all available targets
```

## Contributing

See [WORKFLOW.md](./WORKFLOW.md) for the complete development workflow. Key points:
- All work requires an approved GitHub Issue
- Follow TDD principles
- Maintain clear, well-commented Go code (legibility is a hard requirement)
- Run `make all` before submitting PRs
