# Developer Setup Guide - Kaimi Project

Welcome to the Kaimi project! This guide will help you get set up for development.

## Your GCP Access

You've been granted access to the **kaimi-seeker** GCP project with the following permissions:

### Roles Granted
- ✅ **Vertex AI Admin** (`roles/aiplatform.admin`) - Full access to build and manage models with Gemini 3 Pro
- ✅ **Viewer** (`roles/viewer`) - View all project resources
- ✅ **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** (`roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`) - Read API keys and secrets

### Project Details
- **Project ID:** `kaimi-seeker`
- **Project Name:** Kaimi - The Seeker
- **Region:** `us-east4`
- **Billing:** Google AI Hackathon account

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Required Tools

**Go (1.21+):**
- Download: https://go.dev/download/
- Verify: `go version`

**gcloud CLI:**
- Download: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
- Verify: `gcloud --version`

**golangci-lint:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install golangci-lint

# Linux
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin

# Windows
# Download from https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases
```

**Git:**
- Already installed if you can clone repos
- Verify: `git --version`

---

## GCP Setup

### 1. Authenticate with Google Cloud

```bash
# Login with your Google account (thaithimmy2003@gmail.com)
gcloud auth login

# Set the project
gcloud config set project kaimi-seeker

# Verify access
gcloud projects describe kaimi-seeker
```

You should see:
```
projectId: kaimi-seeker
name: Kaimi - The Seeker
```

### 2. Set Up Application Default Credentials (ADC)

For local development, set up ADC so your code can authenticate:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

This allows your local Go code to access:
- Vertex AI (Gemini 3 Pro)
- Secret Manager (SAM.gov API key)
- Other GCP services

### 3. Verify Access

**Test Vertex AI access:**
```bash
gcloud ai models list --region=us-east4 --limit=5
```

**Test Secret Manager access:**
```bash
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=samgov-api-key
```

You should see: `SAM-1c27e3e7-1fb5-4f85-bece-adb7d8b77dec`

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mawar2/Kaimi.git
cd Kaimi
```

### 2. Install Go Dependencies

```bash
go mod download
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run linter
make lint

# Build binaries
make build
```

All commands should complete successfully.

---

## Environment Configuration

### Option 1: Use Application Default Credentials (Recommended for you)

Since you ran `gcloud auth application-default login`, your code will automatically use your user credentials.

**No additional setup needed!** Your user account has all necessary permissions.

### Option 2: Use Service Account Key (CI/CD method)

If you want to match the CI/CD environment exactly:

1. Ask the project owner for `kaimi-sa-key.json`
2. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/kaimi-sa-key.json
   ```

**For local development, Option 1 is easier and recommended.**

---

## Development Workflow

### Required Reading

Before writing any code, read these documents:

1. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design and phase roadmap
2. **[WORKFLOW.md](../WORKFLOW.md)** - Engineering workflow contract (CRITICAL!)

### Key Workflow Rules

From WORKFLOW.md, you **must** follow these rules:

#### 1. No Work Without a Ticket
- Every task requires a GitHub Issue with approved acceptance criteria
- Create the Issue first, get approval, then code
- Reference the Issue number in commits and PRs

#### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
```bash
# 1. Write the failing test first
# 2. Run it and watch it fail
make test

# 3. Write code to make it pass
# 4. Run tests again
make test

# 5. All tests must pass before committing
```

#### 3. Commit Format
```
<issue_number>_<feature_description>

Example: 12_hunter_samgov_cached_mode
```

#### 4. Before Opening a PR
```bash
# Run all checks
make all

# This runs:
# - make build (compiles code)
# - make test (runs all tests)
# - make lint (runs linter)

# All must pass!
```

#### 5. Pull Request Requirements
- PR must reference a GitHub Issue (in title or description)
- All tests must pass
- Linter must pass
- CI/CD pipeline must pass
- Human approval required (Malik or team lead)

### Common Make Commands

```bash
make help       # Show all available commands
make build      # Build all binaries
make test       # Run all tests
make lint       # Run linter
make all        # Build + test + lint (run before PR!)
make clean      # Remove build artifacts
```

## Current Phase: Phase 0

**What We're Building Right Now:**
- ✅ Project foundation (done)
- ✅ Go module and structure (done)
- ✅ Core interfaces (Store, SAM.gov Client) (done)
- ✅ Opportunity schema (done)
- 🚧 Hunter agent implementation (in progress)

**What We're NOT Building Yet:**
- ❌ Scorer agent (Phase 1)
- ❌ Manager agent (Phase 2)
- ❌ Proposal writers (Phase 3)
- ❌ Firestore database (Phase 1)
- ❌ Cloud Scheduler (Phase 1)

**Scope Discipline:**
Only build Phase 0 components. Don't build ahead. See ARCHITECTURE.md for details.

---

## Vertex AI / Gemini Access

You have full admin access to Vertex AI. You can:

### Use Gemini 3 Pro

```go
// Example: Using Vertex AI in Go
import (
    aiplatform "cloud.google.com/go/aiplatform/apiv1"
    "google.golang.org/api/option"
)

// Your ADC will authenticate automatically
client, err := aiplatform.NewPredictionClient(ctx)
```

### Test Gemini Access

```bash
# List available models (you have permission)
gcloud ai models list --region=us-east4

# Test Gemini endpoint access
gcloud ai endpoints list --region=us-east4
```

---

## Secret Manager Access

You can read secrets (but not create/modify them).

### Read SAM.gov API Key

```bash
# Via gcloud
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=samgov-api-key

# In Go code (using Google ADK)
# The Hunter agent will use this for SAM.gov API calls
```

## Git Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Format: <issue_number>_<feature_name>
git checkout -b 5_hunter_implementation
```

### 2. Make Changes (TDD!)

```bash
# Write tests first
# Run tests (they should fail)
make test

# Write code
# Run tests again (they should pass)
make test
```

### 3. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "5_hunter_samgov_client

Implemented SAM.gov API client with:
- Opportunity fetching by NAICS code
- Cached mode for testing
- Error handling and retries

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### 4. Push and Open PR

```bash
git push origin 5_hunter_implementation
```

Then open a PR on GitHub with:
- Title referencing the Issue: "[#5] Hunter SAM.gov client implementation"
- Description with acceptance criteria checklist

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

On every push, GitHub Actions runs:

1. ✅ **Tests** - All Go tests must pass
2. ✅ **Lint** - golangci-lint must pass
3. ✅ **GCP Verification** - Verify Vertex AI and Secret Manager access
4. ✅ **Acceptance Criteria Check** - PR must reference an Issue

**All must pass before merge!**
